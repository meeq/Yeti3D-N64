YETI3D PRO Source Code
Dated: 17/8/2004

Here is a copy of Yeti3D PRO taken from a backup CD dated 17/8/2004.

Only the core source code is provided. None of the original sprites or MD2 
models are provided, except the ANSI C data files.

I have included the World Editor and MD2 Model Converter tools which require
Borland C++Builder 6+ to compile. You should be able to get them running
on older versions with some hacking.

I have included the Win32 platform code which will show you how to get a 
basic Yeti3D PRO system running.

This project is as old as the hills and I doubt this was the last version.

Use this code as you will.
